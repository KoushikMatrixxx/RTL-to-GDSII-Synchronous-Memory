## 📖 Project Overview

This repository presents the complete ASIC Physical Design implementation of a synchronous memory block, starting from a synthesized gate-level netlist and progressing through every major stage of the RTL-to-GDSII flow.

The implementation was carried out using **Cadence Innovus 21.15** on a **90nm CMOS technology**, covering floorplanning, power planning, placement, clock tree synthesis (CTS), post-CTS optimization, routing, physical verification, and final GDSII stream-out.

The project covers the complete ASIC backend flow, including:
- Floorplanning
- Power Planning
- Placement
- Clock Tree Synthesis (CTS)
- Post-CTS Optimization
- Routing
- Physical Verification
- GDSII Stream-Out
